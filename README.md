# 🎯 100 Days of 100 Projects
### *One project every day. One step closer to mastery.*

Welcome to my **100DaysOf100Projects** journey — a personal challenge where I commit to building **100 real, functional projects in 100 days** using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and other technologies I explore along the way.

This challenge isn’t about perfection.  
It’s about **consistency, creativity, and continuous improvement**.

## 🌱 Why I Started This Challenge
I realized that the fastest way to grow as a developer is by *building*, not just learning.  
So I decided to create small but meaningful projects every day to:

- Strengthen my fundamentals  
- Improve problem-solving skills  
- Build real-world mini apps  
- Explore new ideas and technologies  
- Stay accountable and disciplined  
- Grow confidence as a developer

## 🛠️ What to Expect
Across these 100 days, I’ll be building:

- Mini games  
- UI components  
- Web utilities  
- Creative animations  
- JavaScript logic-based projects  
- Full-stack micro features  
- AI-powered mini tools  
- And whatever inspires me on that day  

Each project will be:

- **Fully functional**  
- **Built from scratch**  
- **Open for everyone to learn from**

## 📌 My Rules

1. One project every day — no skipping.  
2. Projects can be small but must be complete.  
3. Avoid frameworks unless required; focus on fundamentals.  
4. Share progress daily to stay accountable.  
5. Most importantly: **Have fun building.**

## 🚀 The Goal

By the end of 100 days, I aim to:

- Sharpen my logic  
- Strengthen my UI/UX skills  
- Speed up my real-world problem-solving  
- Build a strong project portfolio
